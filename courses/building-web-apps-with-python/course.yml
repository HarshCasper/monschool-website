    The web is the ultimate platform to build applications. You don't need permission to make an application for the web, and it's the platform anyone can build an application and publish it without anyone's approval.  The best part is web development is very beginner-friendly. In this course, we will learn to make websites that you can share with your friends and family.  We will also create web applications that respond to users using Python - the friendliest programming language.
