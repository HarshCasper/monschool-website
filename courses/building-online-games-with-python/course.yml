title: Building Online Games with Python
instructor: arun_ravindran
short_introduction: Build online games with Python and impress your friends
description: |
  Have you ever wanted to write your own game?
  Ever wondered if your friends could enjoy a gaming experience that you crafted?
  Modern games are very complex pieces of software. But you could still learn
  the fundamentals of game development, if you are familiar with Python - one of
  the most beginner friendly programming languages. This course starts from
  the very basics of creating animations and progresses until you could build
  a fully interactive game. Unlike other Python based games, these games run
  completely in the browser and are easy to share with your friends.
