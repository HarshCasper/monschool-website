short_introduction: A gentle introduction to the Rust programming language
description: |
  Rust has been voted the most loved programming language by participants in the
  Stack overflow Developer Survey for the last 5 years in a row. This has a lot
  to do with how the language helps developers write quick and clean programs that
  don't sacrifice much on performance, powered by a state of the art compiler and
  set of tools that help you make awesome software.

  In this course, we have curated learning resources and practice problems that will
  help you get started quickly and understand how to write, compile and optimise
  programs in rust-lang.
