title: Getting to know crates.io and docs.rs
---

The rust crate ecosystem consists of two important places where you can get yourself up-to-date about the latest crates and their function API documentation. [crates.io](https://crates.io) is a directory of all published crates that you can download and use with cargo.

Every crate that has been published has it's own landing page and a few informational graphs showing how popular the crate is or has been, on the same page you get to see what licenses it supports, when it was last updated, what version is current and links to where you can find the documentation or code for the crate.

In this lesson, we will also learn about how you can write your own crate function/API documentation and publish it for the world to read.
