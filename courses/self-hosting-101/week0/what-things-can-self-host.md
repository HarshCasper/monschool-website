There's a wide variety of things that you can self-host, but here are some practical use case scenarios:

### Personal Website

This arguably is one of the simplest to self-host if you are running a static website. You can deploy a _Reverse Proxy_(we'll learn more about that in [Week 2](./../week2/_overview.md) and serve static HTML/CSS files.

### Version Control Software

GitHub is a popular choice of tool for a VCS. But you can always set up a secondary backup tool for your `.git` repos by self-hosting Gitlab, Gitea and the likes.

### Wikis

If you want to write your wiki, there are many tools available - Bookstack, DokuWiki to name a few. You get full control over the data you enter in the wiki which is a nice benefit over using a SAAS tool.

The list is long and there are just too many FOSS things you can self-host. You can explore [Awesome Self Hosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) list to indulge yourself more and prepare a small list of software that you want to deploy by the end of this course! :)
