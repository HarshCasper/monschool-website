There's a wide variety of things that you can self-host, but here are some practical use case scenarios:

### Personal Website

This arguably is one of the simplest to self-host if you are running a static website. You can deploy a Web Server (we'll learn more about that in [Week 2](./../week2/_overview.md) and serve static HTML/CSS files. There are many static site generators available as well (like Hugo, Jekyll etc) which generate static assets (HTML/CSS/JS) that can be served in a similar way.

### Personal Projects

If you're a developer, you'll find the need to showcase your project to the world. There are some PAAS (_Platform as a Service_) providers like Heroku which help you deploy your projects but more often it's a black-box solution and sometimes limited as well. This course focusses on each aspect of hosting your projects so you get a deeper understanding and are able to deploy your projects without the need of any managed solutions.

### Version Control Software

GitHub is a popular choice of tool for a VCS. But you can always set up a secondary backup tool for your `git` repos by self-hosting Gitlab, Gitea and the likes.

### Wikis

If you want to write your wiki, there are many tools available - Bookstack, DokuWiki to name a few. You get full control over the data you enter in the wiki which is a nice benefit over using a SAAS tool.

The list is long and there are just too many FOSS things you can self-host. You can explore [Awesome Self Hosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) list to indulge yourself more and prepare a small list of software that you want to deploy by the end of this course! :)
