Welcome to Week 1.

In the first week, we'll begin our self-hosting journey by starting with setting up a VPS(Virtual Private Server) and learning how to configure it. Self Hosting requires us to learn the basics of Linux, like navigating the file system, creating users, editing files, installing packages etc. We'll uncover each of these topics in separate lessons.

The learning objectives for Week 1 are:

- [ ] [Creating a droplet on DigitalOcean](./creating-droplet.md).
- [ ] [Creating Users](./creating-users.md)
- [ ] [Installing Packages](./installing-packages.md)
- [ ] [Learning the filesystem](./working-with-files-directories.md)
- [ ] [Setting up SSH](./setting-up-ssh.md)
- [ ] [Using tmux](./using-tmux.md)

After covering the objectives laid out this week and completing all exercises, we should be able to grasp a basic understanding of the tasks planned for the next upcoming weeks.
