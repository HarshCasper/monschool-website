Welcome to Week 2.

In the second week, we'll learn how to self host a static website. A static website consists of assets like HTML, CSS and some Javascript. We'll learn how to configure a webserver which can serve these files over the internet.

The learning objectives for Week 2 are:

- [Installing NGINX](./installing-nginx.md).
- [Customising Default Index ](./customising-index.md)
- [Creating a new site](./creating-a-site.md)
- [Setting up a site using `git`](./setup-using-git.md)

After covering the objectives laid out this week and completing all exercises, we should be able to grasp a basic understanding of the tasks planned for the next upcoming weeks.
