Congratulations! You've almost done with the Python Primer course. You've learnt enough Python to start doing interesting projects. Here are some tips to build great software.

## Practice, Practice, Practice

There are no shortcuts to develop expertise in any field. It takes deliberate practice and lot of time to master any skill, including programming.

The world is full of interesting challenges. Think of a problem that excites you and try to sovle it in your way. It is okay to reinvent the wheel.

## Programs are written for the people

Young programmers often think, the purpose of writing a program is just to make the computer execute something. While it is important to make something a computer can execute, there is lot more to the craft of programming.

Often a program lives for long time after it is written. It goes though many changes, often by different people. It is really hard to understand a piece of code unless it is written well.

There are many simple techniques like picking right variable names, keeping functions small and independent, supressing the details into different functions etc. to make code a lot readable.

When you are writing a program next time, think if a new person can read the code and understand what is going on? If not, make efforts to make your program easy to read, easy to understand and easy to make changes.

## Embrace the community

The Python community is warm and welcoming. There are many Python user groups in India and other countries.

There a lot to learn from other people. Participate in user group meetings and conferences. Connect with fellow Pythonistas. Learn from the interesting projects others are working on. Learn from their mistakes. Give a talk at user group meeting or a conference. Help other people who are just starting up.

Conduct a Python workshop in your college or your organization.You are welcome to use the material from this course.
